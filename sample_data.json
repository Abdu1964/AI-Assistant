Our state-of-the-art BioAtomspace AI platform is designed to navigate these vast molecular labyrinths. It scans enormous genomic databases to unveil previously undiscovered genetic pathways tied to lifespan and health. With AI, what was once a monumental task is now expedited, allowing us to spotlight new drug targets and swiftly test thousands of compounds for their anti-aging potential. But our quest doesn't stop with genes. We believe in holistic research, meaning we are not concentrating on a fewspecificknowngenesorpathways.Thisiswhatkeptlongevityresearchstuckfor way too long. Consider science's historical obsession with cholesterol. For years, medical professionals focused almost exclusively on LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol levels, believingitwastheprimaryfactorinheart disease. Yet, we now know heart disease is influenced by a plethora of factors inflammation, HDL cholesterol levels, triglycerides, and more. By fixating solely on LDL, we missed the larger, intricate picture. Similarly, look at Alzheimers research as an examplea tale of tunnel vision. For decades, science peered intently at merely two facets of the disease, entranced by the dance of amyloid-beta peptides and the erratic steps of tau proteins. Such narrowed gazes can blind us to the complexities of aging at large. This means we need to assimilate data from myriad sources  from lab tests and wearable health metrics to environmental variables and disease histories. We even take cues from nature. By studying long-lived species like our Methuselah Flies, specially bred for longevity, we gain insights into what grants these organisms extended health and life. These clues potentially unlock secretstoenhancinghumanlongevity. The immense challenge is deciphering the tangled web of interactions among the myriad factors influencing aging.

It's adept at synthesizing vast, multidimensional datasets - like assembling a jigsaw puzzle with countless pieces, each representing part of ourhealthandenvironment.OurAIcanweavetogetherdataongenotype,gut microbiome, blood markers, activity patterns, transcriptome, epigenome, and even external factorslike weather. The result is a comprehensive view of an individual's unique aging journey, identifying key environmental, lifestyle, and molecular triggers. This holistic approach provides granular understanding of aging mechanisms at the cellular level, paving the way for innovative treatments. The BioAtomspace helps unravel aging's complexity, giving us an unprecedented vantage point to advance our anti-aging mission.

The ripple effect of such a success would be monumental, transforming societies at a magnitudereminiscentoftheantibioticrevolution. The Problem Why arent we curing aging faster? Aging research, for the longest time, was like tryingtoreadanovelindimcandlelightchallenging,often mystifying, with many pages stucktogether.Butastheworldevolved,sodidthecuriositytounderstand this inevitable journey, paving the way for a multitude of questions and challenges. Overall, there are manyreasonswhyresearchonlongevityagingwascomparablyslowinpastdecades 1. The Pitfall of After-the-fact Solutions Picture this you're at the beach, building a sandcastle. But instead of constructing a strong foundation, you're more focused on patching up the little holes that keep popping up as waves roll in. It's an exhausting, never-ending cycle. Similarly, medicine has reacted to aging instead of preventing it. Resources go toward treating diseases after they arise rather than researching prevention. It'slikefixing cracksinadaminsteadofengineeringarobustonefromthestart. Alzheimer's is a prime example. Efforts center on managing late-stage symptoms rather than understanding early precursors. The challenge lies in shifting from late intervention to early prevention. We need to move upstream and address the origins of aging itself. That is the only way to build a formidabledamagainstthedownstreamtorrentofage-relateddiseases.Preventionfirst,reactionlater. 2. The Chronological Challenge of Longevity Research Humans inherently live for decades, which makes observing the long-term impacts of interventions a slow and challenging process. When we turn to animal studies, hoping for aquickerresolution,wefind ourselves still bound by time. A mouse might live for two years, but its lifespanisstillalengthychapter in the story of anti-aging research. Understanding the intricacies of longevity in such a time-limited frame poses its own set of challenges. In addition, the traditional old pharmaceutical research and development (RD) process is long and arduous, involving numerous steps from the discovery of a potential drug target to the approval of a new drug by regulatory bodies. Taken together, anti-aging researchwasdoomedforalongtime. Fig. 1 Classical Drug development takes time. Identifying potential drug molecules or \"leads\" involves exhaustive lab work and then screening of thousands, sometimes millions, of compounds. Scientists must then refine these leads to have the desired effect on the target without being toxic. Before testing in humans, potential drugs undergo rigorous laboratory and animal testing. These tests assess the drug's safety profile, pharmacodynamics (what the drug does to the body), and pharmacokinetics (how the body processes the drug). Phase 1 Clinical Trials Typically involving a small number of healthy volunteers, this phase assesses the drug'ssafety,dosageranges,sideeffects,andhowit'smetabolizedandexcreted.Phase2 Clinical Trials Here, the drug's effectiveness is tested on a larger group of patients, often a few hundred, who have the condition the drug aims to treat. Researchers also monitor side effects and determine optimaldosing.Phase3ClinicalTrials This phase involves large-scale testing on hundreds to thousands of patients, further evaluatingthedrug'seffectivenessand monitoring adverse reactions in a diverse population."

The Untapped Potential of Cross-dataset Analysis With the availability of vast amounts of data from both human and animal studies, one would assume researchers would eagerly delve into cross-dataset analysis. Unfortunately, this remains a neglected area. Integrating findings from, say, fruit fly longevity studies with those of human cellular aging could potentially provide richer insights. The reluctance to tap into this 'treasure trove' could be attributed to factors like data inconsistency or the sheer magnitude of information. Yet, by not diving into this treasure,wereleavingsomeofthemostthrillingchaptersofourlongevitysagaunread. 4. The underutilized Giant  Personalized Medicine While some people might grapple with osteoporosis in their golden years, others might face cardiovascular challenges. This calls for personalized medicinean approach tailored to individual genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Sadly, this giant remains largely dormant. Viewingagingas a jigsaw puzzle, it's clear that a one-size-fits-all approach will not suffice. With billions of pieces representing diverse aging paths, we need a comprehensive view to truly address the challenges of aging. 5. The Complex Web of Aging Aging is complex. The interplay between genetics, environment, metabolism, and more, paints a multi-dimensional picture. Addressing aging, therefore, isn't just about tackling individual threads but understanding and managing the intricate network. The dawn of artificial general intelligence offers a solution. This next generation ofcomputationalpowermightholdthekeytomappingandnavigatingthe vastandcomplexterrainofhumanaging. The longevity industry has a seasoned roadmap, though many overlook its history.

Understanding OpenCog Hyperon, the BioAtomspace, and MeTTa Rejuve.Bios AI platform evolved from the OpenCog AI ecosystem. OpenCog Hyperon is an advanced software development framework that aims to support the creation of systems with artificial general intelligence (AGI) at or beyond human-level capabilities. OpenCogs core design feature is the Atomspace, a distributed metagraph consisting of nodes and links labeled with various types of information. What makes it special? It organizes data in a unique way that allows AI to complete vital operationsmoreefficiently,boostingperformancespeedsandconservingmemory.

To put it simply, BioAtomspace is the brain behind our AI framework.It'sanavant-gardesystemrooted inthenotionofhypergraphs,reshapingthewaywestoreandretrieveinformationintheAIrealm. Fig. 3 The Bioatomspace is a metagraph (graph of graphs) knowledge base that combines existing publicly available biological reference data, proprietary experimental data, and semantic representations of scientific publications in a format directly interpretable by symbolic inference engines (like the Opencog PLN system) and by state of the art foundational transformermodels(chatGPTetal)viagraphembeddings.Thismultiplicityofalgorithmscanjoinforcesinacognitivesynergy totackleproblemsbeyondthereachofanyoneAIormachinelearningtechnique. The uniqueness of the BioAtomspace as explained by our AI Guru, Dr. Ben Goertzel, fordecadesoneof the leading minds in AI research The Atomspace representational framework provides a level of abstraction that allows multiple types of biological knowledge to be expressed in ways that are natural in terms oftheirownintrinsicproperties,butalsoconnectcleanlyandinaneasilymanipulablewaywith other types of knowledge. Relationships from research papers, discrete data like gene sequences, continuous data like gene expression vectors or clinical lab test values, dynamical data regarding the time-course of various parameters within an organ or organism, can all be represented in clear and interdependent ways. But this is notwhereitends.Avarietyofreasoning,learning,patternmining,and concepthypothesis formation methods are then implemented on top of this representational fabric, leveraging its generality to make discoveries and conjectures that span datasets, levels of organization, organismsandspecies. High-Level Representation and Processing Lets step back another step to illustrate what we build, starting from Graph Theory. Graph theory is a significant component of many AI-relateddisciplines,includingneuralnetworks,pathfindingalgorithms, and more. Graphs provide a flexible and robust framework for modeling and analyzing various kindsof complex structures, from social networks to the structure ofthewebtovariouskindsofbiologicaldata. For simple queries and basic predicate-argument relationships, various simple graphs could suffice. They are effective infrastructures for triple stores, basic databases that store information as a trio of entities. However, the power of the BioAtomspace is unveiled when one seeks a more abstract representationofknowledge. The BioAtomspace excels inrepresentingknowledgeinfirstorhigher-orderpredicatelogicthatsatype of logic that is used to represent knowledge about relationships between concepts. It can handle complex relationships involving higher-order functions (functions that can take functions as inputs or outputs), nested universally and existentially quantified variables, and uncertainty - all crucial for real-world applications. In simpler language The BioAtomspace system is different because it can represent knowledge in a more abstract way. This means that it can represent knowledge about relationships between concepts, as well as knowledge about the properties of concepts. For example, the BioAtomspace system can represent knowledge about the relationship between genes, longevity, and diseases. This knowledge can then be used to develop new drugs or treatments against aging. The ability to represent knowledge about the properties of concepts is also important because it allows the BioAtomspace system to represent more precise knowledge. For example, the system can represent knowledge about the properties of a gene, such as its location on a chromosome or its function. This knowledge can then be used to understand how genes work and how they interact with each other."

In the realm of artificial intelligence and graph technology, hypergraphs can serve as a more accurate and versatile representation of complex relationships, particularly when modeling relational data or intricate, higher-dimensionalrelationships. Vertices Vertices are essentially the individual points or 'dots' in a graph or a network. For example, imagine you're drawing a connect-the-dots picture. Each of those dots you're connecting is a vertex. And whenyoudrawalinebetweentwodots,thatlineissimilartowhatwecallan'edge'ingraphtheory.If you're thinking about social networks, a vertex could represent a person. If it's a transportation network, a vertex could represent a city or a bus stop. If it's a molecular network in biology, avertex could represent a molecule. So, in essence, verticesarethefundamentalunitsor'buildingblocks'that we use to create and describe networks or graphs in our research. They represent the entities of interest,andtherelationshipsbetweenthemarerepresentedbylinesoredges. Let's explain this conceptusingabiologicalexample,suchasmolecularnetworks.Forinstance,consider the representation of complex biological interactions like metabolic pathways.Atraditionalgraphmight use vertices to represent different molecules (like enzymes and metabolites), and edges to represent binary reactions between them. However, this binary model can fall short of accurately representing multi-componentreactionsorsystemswheremultiplemoleculesinteractsimultaneously. Here is where hypergraphs shine. In a hypergraph, a single edge - often referred to as a \"hyperedge\" - can link any number of vertices, enabling the representation of more complex relationships. In our example, this allows for accurate modeling of reactions involving more than two molecular entities or intricate pathways with concurrent reactions. This powerful representation is of great value in AI. For instance, hypergraphs could be used to better understand the complex biochemical interactions in a cell,toidentifypotentialdrugtargetsinagingmedicine,ortopredicttheeffectsofvariouscompoundsin bioinformatics. Meta-Representational Knowledge Graph Another key differentiator is BioAtomspaces ability to act as ameta-representationalknowledgegraph. It allows the integration of various subgraphs each with different knowledge representation schemes under a single unified architecture. For instance, one subgraph could be oriented towards natural language, another dealing with formal mathematics, and yet another for functional or imperative programming languages. Instead of maintaining separate knowledge graphs for each type, the BioAtomspace provides a unified graph for all, enabling shared knowledge andinterlinkingbetweenthe differenttypesofknowledge. Neural-Symbolic AI Integration A revolutionary aspect of the BioAtomspace is its capability to facilitate two-way interaction between neural nets and symbolic AI.Whileotherframeworkspermitconsultationbylargelanguagemodels,the BioAtomspace is designed to encourage a symbiotic relationship between neural and symbolic AI, facilitatingaco-learningenvironment. Neural- and symbolic artificial intelligence are two different approaches to AI that have different strengthsandweaknesses. Neural AI is inspired by the human brain and uses artificial neural networks to learn from data. Neural networks are made upofinterconnectednodesthatcanlearntorecognizepatternsindata. This makes neural AI well-suited for tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing. Symbolic AI is based on knowledge representation and reasoning. Symbolic AI systemsrepresent knowledge in a formal language and use rules to reason about that knowledge. This makes symbolicAIwell-suitedfortaskssuchasplanninganddecision-making. In other words, it doesnt simply relegate symbolic or neural functions to be resources for the other. Rather, it allows intertwined learning and development between the two, a feature unparalleled in the currentAIlandscape."

Overall, BioAtomspaces capability to handle abstract knowledge representation is unrivaled, particularly useful when complex knowledge graphs are needed to enhance Machine Learning Models. The BioAtomspace system is under development, but it is already working beyond expectations, and will revolutionize the way that biological knowledge is represented and used in computers. The ability to represent knowledge in a more abstract way will allow computers to understand and process more complex knowledge. This will lead to new advances in fields such as longevity, medicine, biology, and artificial intelligence.

AD subjects taking ReBuilder, as with the mild AD subjects, continued to score much closer to their baseline than the subjects in the Bernick study (Figure 1C). The trend of baseline score maintenance in subjects taking ReBuilder continues if we separate the subjects by gender. Generally, Alzheimers disease affects more women than men due to women having longer average lifespans, and possibly because of hormonal differences between the genders. In our pilot study, we had nearly equal numbers of each gender, with 16 women and 14 men. Both genders saw positive effects when ReBuilder was added to their standard therapy (Figures 1D and 1E). The E4 variant of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene puts an individual at an increased risk of developing Alzheimers disease. The risk increase is present in an individual with one copy of the E4 allele, and greater still if the individual has 2 copies.

Overall, the subjects taking ReBuilder in our pilot study maintained a CDR-SB score close to their baseline. This suggests that the subjects severity of dementia symptoms did not increase as expected over the 12-month pilot study and that they experienced better stability in their symptoms (Figure 3A). For our mild subjects, the mean CDR-SB scores stayed above baseline for the latter portion of the pilot, possibly indicating a reduction in dementia symptoms (Figure 3B). For moderate subjects, the severity of their dementia symptoms does increase by the end of the pilot study, but not to the same degree that is seen in the Bernick group over the same time Figure 2D Mean Alzheimers Disease Cooperative Study Activities period (Figure 3C). of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Scores for Female Subjects.

Looking at the subjects with the APOE4 genetic variant 110, we also see a reduction in dementia symptoms. This suggests that ReBuilder can improve the symptoms of those genetically predisposed to Alzheimers disease (Figure 3F). On the whole, the above results show that subjects taking ReBuilder during our 12-month pilot at least slowed in their AD progression as indicated by the MMSE, ADCS-ADL, and CDR-SB. In some measures, the subjects appear to stabilize and even reduce their AD symptoms. No adverse side effects such as changes in mood, sleeping habits, balance issues, or digestive disturbances were observed in the subjects treated with ReBuilder.

This assumption has held sway since Aristotle, the chief source of variation in the articulation of this assumption being the historically prevalent fashions in biological thought, from the four Greek ele- mentsofair,fire,water,andearthtocontemporaneousnotionsaboutoxidation,free radicals,andthelike(Rose2007).Thefalsityofthisassumptionisrevealedbythree obduratebiologicalfacts (i) there are organisms like fissile sea anemones and Hydra which show no detectableaging (ii) species are sustained by unbroken cell lineages that are hundreds of millions ofyearsold,whetherthoselineagesengageinsexornotand B M.R.Rose( ) Genescient,LLC,Irvine,CA,USA e-mailmrosegenescient.com G.M.Fahyetal.(eds.),TheFutureofAging,DOI10.1007978-90-481-3999-611, 357 (cid2)C SpringerScienceBusinessMediaB.V.2010 358 M.R.Roseetal. (iii) insomelaboratorycohortsofsufficientsize,actuarialagingcomestoahaltat lateadultages(Rose2008). None of these now well-established features of aging are compatible with the view that aging is simply and solely a result of inexorably accumulating damage, disharmony,orthelike. Instead, aging is due to sustained declines in Hamiltons Forces of Natural Selection (Hamilton 1966 Charlesworth 1980 Rose 1991 Rose et al. 2007). Natural selection is what produces adaptation, the term adaptation referring to attributes useful for survival and reproduction. As the power of natural selection declines,adeclinethatHamiltonsForcesquantifyexplicitlyandfromfirstprinci- ples,adaptationisexpectedtodecline.Thisishowevolutionarybiologistsexplain aging. Cases in which aging does not occur at all, such as strictly and symmetrically fissilespeciesorevolvinggermlines,areinstanceswhereHamiltonsForcesdonot declineatanypoint.Notably,ithasrecentlybeenshownthattheapparentcessation ofaginglateinadultlifeisalsoexplicableintermsofHamiltonsForces(Mueller andRose1996Roseetal.2002Rauseretal.2006).Thatis,thereisadirectcor- respondence between situations in which aging is not observed and circumstances inwhichHamiltonsForcesdonotdecline.Thisisoneofmanytypesofempirical evidencethatsupporttheHamiltonianexplanationofaging(Rose1991Roseetal. 2007).SignificantlyforPopperianscientists,therearenowell-attestedrefutationsof theHamiltoniantheoryofaging.ThisisasignificantadvantageoftheHamiltonian theory of aging for evolutionary geneticists, physicists, and other scientists who practicestronginference(vid.Platt1964)."

    "content": "At this point, a reader of the gerontological literature might point to the longevity mutants that have been such an obsession in recent gerontological research (reviewed in Guarente and Kenyon 2000, as well as Arking 2006). Such longevity mutations have been known for more than fifty years (e.g. Maynard Smith 1958). When they are studied with greater and greater care for their side- effects, which has not always been standard practice within the gerontological researchcommunity,theyarecharacteristicallyfoundtoshowdebilitatingeffectson fitness,reproduction,andrelatedfunctions(VanVoorhiesetal.2006).Thepathways that are knocked-out by these longevity mutants typically produce extended lifespan in a manner that is achieved at great physiological cost, such as sterility, dwarfism,ormetabolichibernation.Suchside-effectsmaketheselongevitygenes unlikely targets for the extension of human healthspan, although they might be useful targets for preserving the lives of hospitalized patients under extreme med- ical conditions, in which reproductive incapacitation or impaired cognition might notbeissues.

This does NOT mean ingesting large quantities of hundreds of supplements that one or another molec- ularbiologistsupposesmightbebeneficialbasedonresultsobtainedusinginvitro cell cultures. Indeed, the wholesale failure of such research to produce extended human healthspans suggests the greatest caution in using guidelines derived from suchwork. The Hamiltonian perspective suggests instead using nutritional supplements in thesamemannerasevolutionusesgeneticvariantsofsmalleffect.Geneticchanges that do not have massively disruptive effects, unlike the longevity mutants, are likely to alter a number of physiological mechanisms a small amount. Similarly, nutritionalsupplementsthatdonothavedrasticeffectsarelikelytohavemoderate effectsonanumberofphysiologicalmechanisms.ThisdoesNOT,however,mean thattheseeffectsareonthewholebenign.Justthattheyaremoderate. In Hamiltonian experiments in which we evolve postponed aging in model animal species, natural selection screens such moderate, often diffuse, genetic effects, favoring those variants that have benign effects accumulated over the entire spectrum of physiological functions. Likewise, we have to screen candi- date nutrigenomic agents for their benefits, just as natural selection would.

Long1,2, Zachary S. Greenspan1, Lee F. Greer1,2, Molly K. Burke3, accepted 21 November 2016 Bryant Villeponteau2, Kennedy C. Matsagas2, Cristina L. Rizza2, Laurence D. Mueller1,2  Published 22 December 2016 Michael R. Rose1 Experimental evolutionary genomics now allows biologists to test fundamental theories concerning the genetic basis of adaptation. We have conducted one of the longest laboratory evolution experiments with any sexually-reproducing metazoan, Drosophila melanogaster. We used next-generation resequencing data from this experiment to examine genome-wide patterns of genetic variation over an evolutionary time-scale that approaches 1,000 generations. We also compared measures of variation within and differentiation between our populations to simulations based on a variety of evolutionary scenarios. Our analysis yielded no clear evidence of hard selective sweeps, whereby natural selection acts to increase the frequency of a newly-arising mutation in a population until it becomes fixed. We do find evidence for selection acting on standing genetic variation, as independent replicate populations exhibit similar population-genetic dynamics, without obvious fixation of candidate alleles under selection. A hidden-Markov model test for selection also found widespread evidence for selection. We found more genetic variation genome-wide, and less differentiation between replicate populations genome-wide, than arose in any of our simulated evolutionary scenarios. The genetic basis of adaptation has historically been a major point of contention among evolutionary biolo- gists1. In recent years, combining genome-wide sequencing and experimental evolution has emerged as a pow- erful method for parsing the genetic underpinnings of adaptation14. Termed the evolve and resequence (ER) approach, these experiments involve sequencing laboratory populations that have been exposed to clearly defined selective pressures in the hopes of making direct connections between patterns of genotypic and phenotypic change5. In the case of largely or wholly asexual populations, genome-wide sequencing has been performed on clones derived from single individuals after many generations of adaption to novel conditions3,6. Since such asexual populations are expected to undergo successive rounds of selective sweeps that purge genetic variation genome-wide7, this is a reasonable approach to the characterization of chiefly clonal evolutionary processes. In the case of outbreeding sexual species, such as Drosophila melanogaster, the more common sequencing strategy in ER experiments has been to pool multiple individuals within or across evolving replicated laboratory populations1,8. This is often referred to as the pool-seq approach4. Results from ER experiments in outbreed- ing sexual species using this pool-seq approach have revealed abundant genetic variation genome-wide, and sug- gest that adaptation is primarily due to selection on standing genetic variation4."

    "content": "However, as most of those studies typically feature populations with relatively small effective population sizes that have been subjected to only a few dozen generations of selection, there is a limit to the conclusions that can be drawn from them regarding the relative importance of selective sweeps versus selection acting on standing genetic variation911, particularly as selective sweeps are likely to take much longer than the few dozens of generations commonly used in selection experiments with metazoa, as opposed to experimental evolution with microbes6. Genome-wide sequencing of genetic variation present in experimentally evolving sexual populations after many generations of selection remains of interest as a method for addressing the relative importance of selec- tive sweeps, particularly from the standpoint of alleles being driven to fixation. Hitchhiking effects arising from successive selective sweeps are not expected to purge genetic variation genome-wide in sexual populations 1University of California, Irvine, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Irvine, CA, 92617, USA. 2Genescient Inc., Fountain Valley, CA 92708, USA. 3Oregon State University, Department of Integrative Biology, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA.

But sufficiently many such selective sweeps acting in conjunction with reductions in heterozy- gosity resulting from background selection and genetic drift conceivably could progressively purge genetic varia- tion, given the moderately small population sizes commonly used in experimental evolution with sexual species13. The data analyzed by Burke et al.1 do not show a widespread purging of genetic variation in populations that had evolved in the lab for some decades. However, save for a single replicate sequenced individually, this study featured data generated from pooling across replicates, which could have potentially masked genetic fixation in individual replicate populations. This raises the question whether genome-wide sequencing of independently evolving, replicate, sexual populations that have been maintained in the lab for hundreds of generations will indeed show a pattern of generally purged genetic variation when these populations are resequenced separately. Here we show that such long-evolved moderate-sized sexual populations do not exhibit the general lack of genetic variation that is characteristic of long-evolved clonal populations. Instead, after sequencing five independent replicate populations sharing a common selection regime, and more than 900 generations of sustained directional selection, we find widespread maintenance of genetic variation genome-wide. While it could be argued we still do not have sufficient generations of selection or population sizes large enough, our study features the best data collected from laboratory evolution to date with respect to the long-term evolution of patterns of genetic variation in sexually reproducing populations of multicellular eukaryotes. Furthermore, we compare measures of variation within and differentiation between our populations to simulated data from a number of evolutionary scenarios. We consistently find that there is more variation maintained in our populations, and less differentiation between replicate populations, than is found in any of the evolutionary scenarios we simulated."

The novel experimental material analyzed here is pooled genomic DNA obtained from each of the five B populations maintained in the Rose laboratory14,15. These five B populations were founded in February 1980 from a single generation of the IV stock studied by Rose and Charlesworth16,17, which was in turn founded in August 1975 from a sample of 200 wild-caught Drosophila melanogaster females obtained by Phillip Ives from his long-studied South Amherst, Massachusetts endemic population18. From their first founding, IV and B populations have been cultured using 14-day discrete generations, with mixing of flies across all culture vessels within replicate populations, at temperatures of 2325 degrees Celsius. Effective popula- tions size (N) are around 1000 based on calculations from demographic data13. e The B populations were pooled and sampled for sequencing at generation 785 from their founding in 1980, in March 2010, though this was after a total of 915 generations of lab domestication since Ives supplied the wild-caught females for founding the laboratory IV stock. From August of 1975 to June of 1981, the IV and B pop- ulations were cultured using corn meal based medium in 16 glass milk pint bottles per population, with 12 L12D light exposure. From June 1981 to March 2010, the B populations sequenced here were cultured in 40 shell vials at densities of 6080 eggs per vial, yielding 5075 adults per vial. This equates to around a minimum census size of 2000 each generation. During this period, these B populations were cultured using banana-molasses medium1 with 24 L0D light exposure14. The pooled genomic DNA was obtained by isolating 250 female flies from each of the five population repli- cates of the B flies, with harvesting ten days after the pupal stage, using the Gentra Puregene Cell Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to standard protocol, after maceration of the fly tissues using Dounce Tissue Grinders (Daigger, Vernon Hill, IL). Genomic DNA concentrations and purities of the samples were assayed by DNA spectrophotometer. Size distributions were visualized by low agarose gel electrophoresis with DNA size markers. Genomic DNAs were stored at  20 C before shipment to Beckman Coulter (Brea, CA) for Illumina paired end sequencing. Reads were 76 bp in length. The fastq files used in our analyses are available through NCBI SRA (BioProject ID PRJNA350701). Mapping of reads. We mapped reads with BWA (version 0.7.8)19 against the D. melanogaster reference genome (version 5.55) using bwa mem20 with default settings. We filtered and sorted the resulting SAM files for reads mapped in proper pairs with a minimum mapping quality of 20 using and converted them to the BAM using the view and sort commands in SAMtools21. These files were then converted to mpileup format once again using SAMtools."

Lastly, we used RepeatMasker 4.0.3 (httpwww.repeatmasker.org)23 to create a gff file to mask simple sequence repeats and transposable elements of the D. melanogaster genome version 5.55. A table with major and minor allele counts for each SNP in each population was then generated from this syn- chronized file. SNPs where discarded if coverage in any of the populations was less than 20X or greater than 150X. We also required a minimum minor allele frequency of 2 across all five populations. Based on these parameters, 1.2 million SNPs were identified across the major chromosome arms. The average coverage at each called SNP was 62X, 65X, 57X, 66X, and 69X in B through B respectively. 1 5 Characterizing genetic variation. Local depressions in genetic variation are considered one of the primary means of detecting selective sweeps from population level data24. We calculated and plotted heterozygosity across the five major chromosome arms to see if we could find any such evidence for such depressions in our real and simulated data sets. Heterozygosities were calculated over 100 kb non-overlapping windows directly from the major and minor counts in our SNP table. Watterson theta () was also calculated using PoPoolation25, where the details of these calculations can be found. Mpileups were first made for each population using the bam files mentioned above. We then subsampled (without replacement) to a uniform coverage level of 30X across all pop- ulations, as these calculations can be sensitive to coverage variation. Estimates of genetic parameters were then Scientific RepoRts  639281  DOI 10.1038srep39281 2 www.nature.comscientificreports calculated over 100 kb non-overlapping windows across the major chromosome arms.

Lastly, sufficient coverage (30X) was required for at least 60 of our 100 kb windows for estimates to be generated. F ST estimates. F ST estimates were obtained using the formula F ST  Ht H tHs where H T is heterozygosity based on total population allele frequencies, and H is the average subpopulation heterozygosity in each of the B S populations26. F estimates were made at every polymorphic site in the data set. This was done to quantify the ST levels of differentiation between our five B populations, as well as between replicate populations in our simulated scenarios. F estimates were calculated for the B populations along chromosome 3 R at every polymorphic site. ST This was also done for the simulated data, and once again all polymorphic positions along 3 R not present in the SNP table created from our real data set were discarded."

    "content": "We also used the formula F 1(1 1 )t to generate a predicted F value where N is the effective ST 2N ST population size of each subpopulation and t is the time since divergence from their ancestral population27. This model assumes that population diverge randomly over time and that there is no migration. In the event that there is some level of migration between our populations, we used the formula F  1 where m is equal to the ST 4Nm1 migration rate and the quantity Nm is equal to the number of migrants per generation27,28. This model assumes no mutation and that the migration rate is small. As with the previous model, it corresponds to a scenario where a single population is split into subpopulations at some point and diverges randomly over time. But in this scenario, migration has placed a limit on how much these subpopulations can diverge and assumes that the populations have reached this limit and are at equilibrium. It is worth noting that this assumption of equilibrium might not be met in our system. Simulations. To perform our first set of simulations we used MimicrEE (httpssourceforge.netprojects mimicree)29, a forward simulation specifically designed to mimic experimental evolution. It simulates popula- tions of diploid individuals where genomes are provided as haplotypes with two haplotypes constituting a diploid genome. There are no changes in the demography once the initial population file is submitted and a list of selected loci may be provided. For each selected locus, the selection coefficient (s), the dominance coefficient (h), and the nucleotide of the nonselected allele are provided (w ). The fitness of the heterozygous and homozygous individuals is given by 11 w  1, w  1  hs, and w  1  s30. The simulation assumes multiplicative fitness when several selected loci 11 12 22 are specified. No de novo mutations are considered, as its purpose is to simulate scenarios where adaptation results from selection on standing genetic variation. The simulated populations have non-overlapping generations and all individuals are hermaphrodites (though selfing is excluded). At each generation, matings are performed, where mating success (number of offspring) scales linearly with fitness, until the total number of offspring in the population equals the targeted population size (fecundity selection). Each parent contributes a single gamete to the offspring. Crossing-over events are introduced according to a user-specified recombination rate. To generate our starting haplotypes, we started with 105 individuals from the Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel (DGRP)31. We only used positions along chromosome 3 R and only sites that were polymorphic in the B populations. In total, there were 238,291 polymorphic sites after this filtering. From these 105 haplotypes, we randomly sampled with replacement to 1000 to achieve our desired population size. Recombination rates were specified for 100 kb windows and were obtained from the D. melanogaster recombination rate calculator v2.232. As recombination does not occurs in male Drosophila, the empirically estimated female recombination rate was divided by two for the simulations."

    "content": "We first performed neutral simulations, featuring only drift and recombination, to establish a baseline. We then ran simulations across a variety of evolutionary scenarios that involved different numbers of selected loci. Our goal was to see which, if any, of these scenarios would produce the sorts of patterns we observer in our real data set. For each scenario, we simulated five populations for 800 generations. This was then done 100 times for each scenario. In our selection scenarios, we simulated populations with 5, 10, or 20 randomly distributed benefi- cial sites. For one set of simulations, the reference nucleotide (A) was defined as the beneficial allele in each case 1 and was also defined as dominant (h  0). For another set, the A allele was defined as beneficial and dominant 2 (h  1). And for a final set, all selected loci were codominant (h  0.5). For each set, we simulated scenarios with selection coefficients ranging from 0.03 (low) to 0.1 (high) (Table 1). As we increased the number of selected sites, we reduced the selection coefficients to generate scenarios with either few sites of large effect or many sites of small effect. Lastly, we simulated scenarios featuring sites with overdominance to see if extensive balancing selec- tion could be behind the patterns we observe in our data set. In these scenarios, we simulated populations with 20 or 30 randomly distributed sites with overdominance. And once again, we simulated scenarios with a range of selection coefficients (Table 1). From each set of 5 simulated populations under each scenario, we calculated average heterozygosity and average F across all polymorphic sites to compare to values observed in the B populations. We also looked at heterozy- ST gosity and F over 50 kb windows, and calculated the variance between windows as a means of comparing spatial ST variation in heterozygosity and F to what we observe in the B populations. ST Simulations with migration. Given how long our populations have been maintained in the lab, it is easy to imagine that there may have been some instances of migration due to accidental cross-contamination. Thus, in addition to the selection scenarios mentioned above, we performed simulations featuring migration. These simula- tions also feature optimizing selection, as opposed to our other simulations featuring directional and over dominant selection. We once again simulated an evolve-and-resequence experiment for a 63 cM long D."

An R program was created to simulate an initial population of F founder chromosomes expanded and used to found five populations that were then evolved for G generations at a population size of N gametes per population with M migrant gametes in the meta-population per generation. The simulation was accomplished by tracking founder segments and recombination breakpoints over time. So, the N gametes used to found a subpopulation initially consist of a random sample of size N drawn from the numbers 1 through F with replacement. Then each generation to create N new gametes (n  1  N) we draw two gametes with replacement from the previous generation and create a recombination breakpoint at position r  unif (0, 1), if r  0.63 (to simulate a chromosome of 63 cM) and n modulus 2 equal zero (since recombination only takes place in females). Recombinant chromosomes are represented as a pair of vectors a founder state vector, and a recombination breakpoint vector. So, for example, the nth gamete in a population might be S  3, 17, 31, 3 and B  0.20, 0.25, n n 0.60, indicating that gamete has material from founder 3 from 0 to 20 cM, founder 17 from 20 to 25 cM, etc. This sampling scheme models drift and recombination in a Wright-Fisher population. Next we added selection to the simulation."

    "content": "We simulated Q evenly spaced quantitative trait loci (QTL) on the chromosome, with a vector of effect sizes and starting allele frequencies (E and F), with QTL states randomly assigned via binomial sampling given F for each locus. The resulting quantitative trait has a heritability due to q the QTL on 3 R of 12, and an additional polygenic heritability of 38 due to the other chromosomes, and a total phenotypic variance of one. We then model a gametes phenotype as the sum of its effect sizes plus a random Gaussian deviate representing a polygenic component, plus a second random Gaussian deviate representing an environmental deviation, plus the current polygenic mean of the population. The fitness of each gamete is a stand- ard Gaussian fitness function proportional to w  (pheno  NewOptimum)2(2VarianceFitness), normalized to total fitness. Under this selection scheme each generation gametes are resampled proportional to w, resulting in allele frequency changes at the underlying QTL, and resulting changes in the mean phenotype due to those QTL. Furthermore, each generation the polygenic mean (the mean phenotype due to chromosomes other than 3 R) changes according to the Breeders equation33. That is we partition the trait variance into the variance due to tracked loci (each having V  2pqa2), a polygenic component with Gaussian variance V , and environmental a,i i i i apoly variation (V). We held VV constant, but allowed the ratio of V to V to vary. Each generation an individ- e e t a apoly uals phenotypic value is the sum of allelic effects due to tracked loci, a Gaussian deviation due to the polygenic component, and a Gaussian environmental deviate. Those phenotypic values determines a vector of length N consisting of each individuals average fitness based on the Gaussian fitness function, with N individuals chosen with replacement from that vector to create the next generation, with the probability of being chosen proportional to average fitness. Between generations, the mean of the population then shifts due to changes in allele frequencies at both the tracked loci and untracked loci, as predicted by the Breeders equation h2  S. In this context, h2 poly poly is V (V  V) and S is the observed selective differential (i.e., the mean phenotype of individuals chosen to apoly apoly e reproduce minus the mean of the population). By modeling adaptation in this fashion, the population approaches Scientific RepoRts  639281  DOI 10.1038srep39281 4 www.nature.comscientificreports the new optimum due to genetic changes at both tracked and untracked loci. This model thus accommodates adaptation at both the explicitly modeled chromosome arm and the remainder of the genome. Under our model, the overall rate at which the mean phenotype changes in the population is controlled by the distance to the new phenotypic optimum and the variance in fitness, which are set to 15 and 12, respectively."

    "content": "Parameters scaling results in V  0.5 and V  1.0 at generation zero, with a new optimum that is 15 phenotype e p standard deviations away from the population mean, a shift in optimum that was chosen to match experimental evolution experiments in Drosophila (vid. Teotonio and Rose34). The simulation was set up so that a population can reach a new optimum phenotype before all underlying QTL are fixed. Each generation we simulated migration by randomly taking M pairs of gametes in the 5N set being tracked and replacing the first member of the pair with the second. This corresponds to a one-way island model of migra- tion. This means that if the entire population is 5N gametes (where 5 is the number of populations), each genera- tion k gametes are chosen and they essentially overwrite K other gametes. That is to say, one-way means gametes are not exchanged between populations and island means migration is equally likely between any two demes in any direction. We iterated this entire process for G generations to obtain a final set of 5N gametes. Given the relatively short time scale of the experimental evolution experiment, and the relatively modest number of gam- etes, this simulation is fairly efficient in R on a desktop computer. At the end of the simulation we took a set of 100 (F) 3 R chromosomes from the DGRP31, and for each polymorphic position in the real DGRP data we calculated an allele frequency at that site based our simulated populations. This was done because, as with our previous simulations, our starting haplotypes were based on lines from the DGRP. Performing this calculation required a function that maps physical position in bp to cM, and then simply iterates over the founder states at each of the 5N gametes for each SNP. Despite the fact that poolseq estimates allele frequency in the population based on a finite sample of gametes, with the accuracy of that estimate a function of coverage depth and number of gam- etes sampled for the Illumina library, we used the exact allele frequency estimates calculated using the method described above in our downstream calculations. Since libraries are made using a large number of individuals (2 00) and the per site coverage approaches 60X, this simplification is likely acceptable. Using this framework, we simulated a number of evolutionary scenarios that involved varying the following migration rates (M), number of selected QTL, effect sizes of selected QTL, and starting frequencies of selected QTL. Scenarios were simulated using groups of five populations to mimic our observed fly populations. Each scenario was simulated 300 times. All simulations ran for 800 generations (G) and all simulated populations con- sisted of 2000 gametes (N). We simulated scenarios with 0, 1 or 5 migration events per generation (M). We ran simulations with 0 (i.e., a control with only random genetic drift), 3, 10 and 20 selected QTL. Selected QTL were evenly distributed across the chromosome arm."

    "content": "We also looked at the effects of the starting frequency of selected QTL (F) by running simulations where all selected alleles started at either 0.05 or 0.5. As we increased the number of QTL, we reduced their effect sizes (E) so that the sum of squared effect sizes was held constant. This was done to prevent changes in the heritability of the character. For simulations with 3 QTL, effect sizes were 1, 2, and 2. For simulations with 10 QTL, they were 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0.71, and 0.71. And lastly, they were 0.71, 0.71, 0.71, 0.71, 0.71, 0.71, 0.71, 0.71, 0.71, 0.71, 0.71, 0.71, 0.71, 0.71, 0.71, 0.71, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, and 0.5 for simulations with 20 QTL. See Table 2 for all simulated scenarios. Once again, we calculated average heterozygosity and average F across all polymorphic sites to compare with ST the values observed in the B populations. We then again looked at heterozygosity and F over 100 kb windows ST and calculated the variance between windows as a means of comparing spatial variation in heterozygosity and F ST to what we observe in the B populations. Selection Detection. To test for footprints of selection across the genome, we relied on a hidden Markov Model developed with the intention to detect sweeps in pooled sequence data, developed by Boitard et al.35, implemented in the Pool-HMM software package36. Their method involves estimating the allele frequency spec- trum (AFS) across genomic regions and detecting distortions relative to the background AFS, which are expected to occur in regions subject to selection. Though it is worth noting that while this method was developed primarily to detect selective sweeps, it could be instead identifying signatures of any process that produces similar pertur- bations of the AFS. Mpileups for individual populations were used as test inputs, since Pool-HMM can only process data from one population at a time. Scans were performed along each of the major chromosome arms using the following parameters -n 500 (number of chromosomes in each pool), -pred (predicts the hidden state, Neutral (far away from sweep site), Selected (close to sweep site), or Intermediate (between Neutral and Selected) of each SNP), -C 150 (maximum coverage allowed for sites used in this analysis), -r 5 (where 1r is the proportion of sites that are used to estimate the background AFS), -theta  (average  for each population was approximately 0.003 based on estimates from PoPoolation, and increasing or decreasing window size did not affect this result), and  k 1010. The k parameter is the per site transition probability q between neutral and selected states, which is an important tuning parameter for the hidden Markov model underlying this test. As q increases, less evidence is required for a transition to selection and more sweep candidates should be detected. We also ran tests under more (q  1011) and less stringent (q  109) conditions, which only led to slight differences in the number of footprints detected (Table 3)."

Results Genetic Variation. Plotting measures of genetic variation, heterozygosity and Watterson theta (), across 100 kb non-overlapping windows reveals depressions in genetic variation across all major chromosomes arms in the B populations (Fig. 1, see Supplementary Fig. S1. for mean heterozygosity and  across all 5 populations). This pattern is robust to both increased (150 kb) and decreased (30 and 50 kb) window size (Supplementary Figs S2S4). Many depressions in heterozygosity are consistent across the 5 replicate populations, which may be indicative of selection on standing variation. In general, there is a great deal of similarity in patterns of heterozygosity across replicates (Supplementary Fig. S5 shows pair-wise comparisons between all replicates). As in Burke et al.1, we find no regions where genetic variation has been completely expunged in an unambiguous manner. However, there Scientific RepoRts  639281  DOI 10.1038srep39281 6 www.nature.comscientificreports Figure 1.

All replicates are shown. are regions that show very low levels of heterozygosity (0.2) and theta (  0.001) consistently across replicates (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). In addition, the vast majority of these regions are located in chromosome X. Such regions may arise from incomplete selective sweeps or balanced selective equilibria that are close to fixation boundaries. Nonetheless, we have not found cases that conform to the pattern of heterozygosity expected with hard selective sweeps proceeding all the way to fixation7, despite almost 1,000 generations of sustained selection."

    "content": "We used average heterozygosity as our primary measure of variation when comparing our quantitative results from the actual data obtained from the B populations to the corresponding results obtained from the different evolutionary scenarios we simulated. Average heterozygosity in the starting base population used in our simula- tions (see Materials and Methods) was 0.32. Average heterozygosity across 3 R was lower in the five B-population replicate data at 0.28, 0.29, 0.28, 0.27, and 0.27, respectively. We find lower levels of heterozygosity after 800 generations in all of our evolutionary scenarios (Table 1 and Table 2). Spatial variance in heterozygosity along the chromosome arm, based on calculations from 50 kb windows, were as follows for the five B replicates 0.21, 0.24, 0.24, 0.37, and 0.37. In our simulations performed using MimicrEE, we found that the addition of selection does result in greater losses in heterozygosity than genetic drift alone, as expected (Table 1). In our scenarios where the A allele is dom- 1 inant and beneficial at each selected site, we found that increasing the number of selected sites produced greater reductions in heterozygosity (Table 1). This was also true when the A allele was dominant or if we used a selec- 2 tion model featuring codominance. In terms of spatial variance in heterozygosity, we find the highest levels in scenarios featuring strong selection at 3 (0.055 to 0.060) sites or weaker selection at 20 sites (Table 1). The lowest levels of spatial variance, which were comparable to the higher end of what was observed in the B populations, were found in scenarios with selection at 10 sites (0.0035 to 0.0040). In our scenarios with overdominance, we found that increasing the number of sites under selection and increasing selection coefficients both produce greater reductions in heterozygosity near locations undergoing selection. Heterozygosity was maintained at the selected sites themselves and selected alleles approach predicted equilibrium frequencies based on our settings, but heterozygosity was nonetheless reduced in surrounding regions. We also found spatial variance in heterozygosity to be higher than what we typically observed in the B populations, with the exception of scenarios featuring 30 sites with small selection coefficients (0.34) (Table 1). In our simulations with migration, we once again found that the addition of selection results in greater reductions in heterozygosity overall (Table 2). Increasing the number of selected QTLs again produced a greater decrease in heterozygosity. Increasing migrations rates resulted in more variation being maintained, as did increasing the starting frequencies of selected QTLs however, the simulated levels of genetic variation never achieved the levels seen in the actual B populations. In terms of genome-wide variance in heterozygosity, allowing migration and increasing the starting frequencies of selected QTLs produced results closer to those observed in the B populations (Table 2).

Of the hundreds of candidate selected regions detected, there were 35 regions that overlapped across all five replicates (Fig. 3). However, as many of these regions were in excess of 100 kb, these results do not definitively point to any specific genes as being targets of selection. We also applied pool-HMM to results from our neutral simulations, both those including and those excluding migration. We applied the test to regions consisting of 100 kb sampled from our neutral simulations using the same settings we applied to the data from the B populations. Using these settings, we found very few instances where selection was detected, suggesting a low false positive rate (Supplementary Table S3). For instance, we only found 2 instances where selection was falsely detected after applying pool-HMM to 300 100 kb regions sampled from our neutral simulations with no migration. This was also true for 300 regions sampled from neutral simula- tions with M  1. Lastly, when M  5 there were zero instances where selection was falsely detected. We also ran pool-HMM on results from the entirety of 3 R for several of the simulated neutral and selective scenarios we tested. We did this for one simulated population from each of the following scenarios neutral evo- lution with M  0, 5 and 20 3 selected QTLs with low starting frequencies with M  0, 5 and 20 3 selected QTLs with high starting frequencies with M  0, 5 and 20 10 selected QTLs with low starting frequencies with M  0, 5 and 20 10 selected QTLs with high starting frequencies with M  0, 5 and 20. Once again, few regions were identified as being under selection when pool-HMM was applied to results from our neutral simulations relative to what we observe in the B populations. Seven regions in total were detected when we applied it to results from a neutral simulation with M  0, 2 regions when M  5, and 0 when M  20 (Supplementary Fig. S6). However, we found pool-HMMs ability to detect selected QTL to be highly dependent on the starting fre- quency of the selected QTL and on assumed migration rates. When starting frequencies are low (0.05) and there is no migration, there is some correspondence between the regions identified by pool-HMM and the locations of the actual selected QTL with pool-HMM identifying regions overlapping or adjacent to selected QTL (Supplementary Figs S7 and S8). However, when the starting frequencies of selected QTL were high (0.5), this correspondence broke down (Supplementary Figs S9 and S10). For instance, when we applied pool-HMM to results from a simulation with zero migration and 10 selected QTLs starting at low frequency, 11 regions Scientific RepoRts  639281  DOI 10.1038srep39281 8 www.nature.comscientificreports Figure 3.

Five of these regions directly overlapped with the locations of our selected QTLs, and the remaining regions were adjacent to selected QTL. However, when we applied pool-HMM to results from a simulation with zero migration and 10 selected QTLs starting at high frequency, only 3 regions were detected (Supplementary Fig. S10). Of these 3 regions, only one overlapped with the location of a selected QTL. Migration also had a pronounced effect on pool-HMMs ability to detected selected QTL. Across all the sce- narios we tested, we found that increased migration rates resulted in reductions in the number of regions identi- fied as being under selection (Supplementary Figs S6S10). As mentioned previously, in scenarios with 10 selected QTLs starting at low frequencies, 11 regions were detected when M  0. However, when M  20 only 4 regions were detected and only one of those overlapped with the location of a selected QTL (Supplementary Fig. S8). Combining high migration rates and high starting frequencies further impaired pool-HMM ability to detect selected QTL. For instance, when M  5 for simulations with 10 QTL starting at high frequencies, pool-HMM did not identify any regions as being under selection. In summary, we found that both migration and the starting frequency of selected alleles affect the rate and accuracy at which pool-HMM identifies regions as being under selection. Consequently, the overall correspond- ence between regions identified by pool-HMM and the location of selected QTL in our simulated results was generally poor. Pool-HMM also detected far fewer regions in our simulated results than in any of the scans of our real data from the B population. This suggests there may be some other evolutionary factor(s) behind the allele frequency distributions in the evolved populations other than those we simulated (selection at modest number of sites, migration, and drift). It is not entirely clear what this factor might be from our results. For instance, this dis- crepancy could be the result of some demographic factor acting on the B populations or some selective scenario not tested. Or perhaps a combination of the two. Discussion Applying all our measures of genetic variation to the five observed Drosophila populations, we found some depres- sions indicating reduced genetic polymorphism. But there are no regions where it was completely expunged. When comparing these results to the combined DGRP lines we used as base populations for our simulations, we found levels of variation in our populations to be lower on average. While there are clearly other factors at play, this disparity could also be due in large part to the nearly 1000 generations of evolutionary domestication that the experimental B populations have been subjected to, domestication that has featured both reduced effective population sizes as well as long-sustained stable patterns of selection."

    "content": "This hypothesis is supported by the local- ized reductions in polymorphism found within our populations, reductions which are consistent with adaptation involving allele frequencies moving part-way toward fixation7. Given that many of these reductions are consistent across our replicates and genetic variation is never entirely depleted, it also seems reasonable to infer that they result from selection on standing genetic variation. Our tests for selection using pool-HMM are also suggestive of a widespread response to selection across the genome in our populations. However, it is unclear how many of these regions are indicative of a recent response Scientific RepoRts  639281  DOI 10.1038srep39281 9 www.nature.comscientificreports to selection, or selection in the wild ancestral population sampled by Ives in 1975. We find a number of regions that are consistently implicated across all replicates, which is perhaps indicative of a parallel response to selection. However, further complicating matters, our tests on data from simulated populations suggest demographic fac- tors and the starting frequencies of selected variants can have pronounced effects on pool-HMMs ability to detect regions under selection. The role of the former in particular warrants further investigation. We found that migra- tion produced large reductions in the number of regions identified as being under selection by pool-HMM across all scenarios we tested. Given the number of regions detected when pool-HMM is applied to the B population sequence data, it seems unlikely that migration between B populations is a major confounding factor. However, it is entirely possible that these results could be due to some other demographic factor or combinations of factors not explored in our simulations. We find that, after almost 1,000 generations of laboratory cultivation, the five replicate B populations studied here are not generally genetically depauperate. This is somewhat surprising, given the moderate N estimates of e Mueller et al.13 for these populations generally a bit less than 1,000. If the only evolutionary processes acting on these populations were selective sweeps, background selection, and genetic drift, then it seems odd that such extensive genetic variation is maintained. The results of our simulation add to this mystery, as we consistently find greater simulated reductions in average heterozygosity than that shown by the B populations, across a range of evolutionary scenarios featuring drift and selection. Note that for more than 900 generations, these populations were maintained under stable conditions with respect to life cycle, illumination, density, and handling vessel. This provided an excellent opportunity for a selective sweep to occur, since the B populations were maintained for a long time in a consistent selection regime, much longer than would be likely to arise in nature. That being said, our simulations are far from perfect. Given the age of our system, we have no record of the starting genetic make-up of our populations. The populations featured in this study were derived from a single population that had been maintained for 130 generations under laboratory conditions. This population was in turn created from 200 gravid females collected in the wild brought into the lab."

    "content": "In contrast, the base population used in our simulations was created by essentially combining a hundred inbred lines from the DGRP. This dif- ference alone represents a major confounding factor. Additionally, while we feel we are justified in excluding the potential for de novo beneficial mutations in our simulations, given the values of our actual N and the number of e generations under selection, there no doubt remains value in exploring a wider range of evolutionary scenarios. However, addressing these issues satisfactorily would constitute a considerable undertaking, well beyond the scope of this project. Laboratory selection experiments with Drosophila have provided a variety of results and interpretations con- cerning the underlying mechanisms of adaptation. For instance, both Turner et al.2 and Zhou et al.37 report patterns of locally-purged genetic variation in evolved populations consistent with the classic signature of com- plete selective sweeps. But we do not find any regions where genetic variation is locally purged in the manner associated with a complete selective sweep, as heterozygosity across the genome in our evolved populations never unambiguously achieves zero values in well-defined local regions of the genome. Our findings are more consistent with those of Burke et al.1, Orozco-terWengel et al.8 and Tobler et al.38 the patterns of adaptation that they found were attributed to selection on standing genetic variation, without complete fixation of favored alleles. This discrepancy may be due to differences in experimental methods. For instance, the study of Turner et al.2 featured an artificial selection experiment in which flies that met specific body size criteria were selected and allowed to reproduce. Their breeding population sizes were substantially smaller than ours, at 160 females and 160 males. This is in contrast to those experimental evolution studies where there is no direct choice of individ- uals who will contribute to the next generation, which might have led to very different patterns of evolution. In Zhou et al.37, the study populations were founded from 27 isogenic lines. Our populations were not created by crossing of inbred lines. The populations studied by Orozco-ter Wengel et al.8 and Tobler et al.38 were founded using 113 isofemale lines, and thus should have had far more genetic variation to begin with than the populations studied by Zhou et al.37, perhaps even more than our founding Ives population, which was started with about 200 fertilized females sampled from the wild14. The only published study that is closely comparable to this one is that of Burke et al.1, also from our laboratory, although that study was somewhat impaired by the use of a single unpooled replicate population alongside two sets of pools of five replicate populations. Nevertheless, it too featured long sustained selection, founding popula- tions that had never been systematically inbred, and five-fold replication of the selected and ancestral treatments. A failure to detect completely depressed heterozygosity in the five-replicate pools of that study could be attributed to differentiation between replicate populations with respect to selective sweeps."

    "content": "However, the single unpooled population (ACO) from the Burke et al. study also did not show clear signatures of completed selective sweeps, 1 despite just over 600 generations of sustained selection. The high degree of similarity in patterns of variation between our five replicate populations is another sur- prising aspect of our results. We found that our observed level of F was in fact much lower than what would be ST predicted by classical theory assuming no migration and random divergence between subpopulation. To produce the level of F we observe using this model would require an effective population size nearly five times greater ST than estimates made from empirical data by Mueller et al.13, and as such we do not believe this discrepancy can be reasonably explained away by issues with our population size estimates. Our attempts to predict how much migration would be required to produce our observed F assuming random divergence and populations at equi- ST, librium suggest that 3 migrants per generation would be sufficient. However, given the nature of our system and its maintenance protocols, migration rates that high every generation seem unlikely. It is also worth noting we have no guarantee that the assumption of equilibrium conditions has been met in our populations, which could confound this estimate39. And this lack of equilibrium convergence serves as a possible explanation as to why migrations rates of 5 per generation did not produce our observed F in simulated scenarios. ST Scientific RepoRts  639281  DOI 10.1038srep39281 10 www.nature.comscientificreports In our simulations, increasing the number of selected sitesQTLs and migration rates both failed to produce comparable F estimates to what we find in the five B populations. Increasing migration rates did produce reduc- ST tions in F and it is likely that a drastic increase in rates of simulated migration per generation would produce ST, something comparable to our observed values. However, once again, migration rates that high every generation do not seem likely, given that these populations are maintained independently and all migration is by definition accidental. It would also likely result in too much genetic variation being maintained, relative to the patterns in our genome-wide data, unless population sizes were also reduced. Our results could possibly be explained by par- allel selection at a large number of loci, but more work would be required to test this hypothesis. And our initial findings suggest even this explanation may not be adequate. Regarding the relative importance of selective sweeps, our results are not conclusive. However, the high levels of genetic variation maintained in these populations in the face of relatively small population sizes, which foster genetic drift and background selection13, together with the long-sustained selection which should foster reduced genetic variation due to selective sweeps, seem difficult to reconcile with the idea of adaptation primarily driven by hard selective sweeps."

Mueller, Bryant Villeponteau, Michael R. Rose GenescientCorporation,CoronaDelMar,California,UnitedStatesofAmerica Abstract BackgroundSmall invertebrate animals, such as nematodes and fruit flies, are increasingly being used to test candidate drugs both for specific therapeutic purposes and for long-term health effects. Some of the protocols used in these experimentsfeaturesuchexperimentaldesignfeaturesaslifelongvirginityandverylowdensities.Bycontrast,theabilityof bothfruitflies andnematodestoresist stressisfrequentlycorrelatedwiththeirlongevityandotherfunctionalmeasures, suggestingthat low-stressassays are notnecessarilythe only usefulprotocol fortesting thelong-term effects ofdrugs. MethodologyPrincipalFindings Here we report an alternative protocol for fruit fly drug-testing that maximizes reproductive opportunities and other types of interaction, with moderately high population densities. We validate this protocolusingtwotypesofexperimentaltests1.Weshowthatthisprotocoldetectspreviouslywell-establishedgenetic differencesbetweenoutbredfruitflypopulations.2.Weshowthatthisprotocolisabletodistinguishamongthelong-term effects ofsimilar types ofdrugswithin twobroad categories, stimulants and tranquilizers. ConclusionsLarge-scale fly drug testing can be conducted using mixed-sex high-density cage assays. We find that the commonly-used stimulants caffeine and theobromine differ dramatically in their chronic functional effects, theobromine being more benign. Likewise, we find that two generic pharmaceutical tranquilizers, lithium carbonate and valproic acid, differdramaticallyintheirchroniceffects,lithiumbeingmorebenign.However,thesefindingsdonotnecessarilyapplyto humansubjects, and we thusdonotrecommend the use ofany onesubstanceover any other.

By using advanced AI to combine data from the long-lived Methuselah Flies and other model organisms with data from the Rejuve Network and other human populations, we can shorten the drug discovery pipeline and rapidly develop novel therapeutics to help people live longer. Exclusive rights to data from long-lived Methuselah Flies (fruit flies) bred for longevity. Multiple interventions and combinations of treatments can be tested across their entire lifespan. Crowdsourced Human Data from a Tokenomically-Incentivized Network collected by partner companyRejuve Network. World-leading community of scientists using neural-symbolic machine learning, reasoning, and transfer learning to analyze animal model data and make hypotheses about human longevity. Unique highly advanced AI toolkit developed for over a decade for exactly this research dynamically leveraged and updated by neural, symbolic and evolutionary algorithms. Rejuve Biotech is developing an innovative drug discovery platform and translational medicine service that combines anin-house model organism population with a unique analytical platform.The platform combines state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial general intelligence methods with acontinuously updated biomedical knowledge graph integrating human and model organism databases. The Rejuve Biotech model of choice is thelong-lived Methuselah Fly, a type of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), selectively bred over hundreds of generations tolive up to 5 times longer than wild-type flies. We can use the sequencing technology to identify specific pathways that contribute to the Methuselah Flies longevity and then use AI and machine learning tools tointegrate that information with human health and omics data, allowing us to identify common genetic pathways that can be studied in real-time using the flies relatively short lifespan, shortening the drug discovery pipeline, and helping todevelop therapeutics that will target aging and aging-related disease.

    "content": "Crowd Fund Product Research Team Advisors Partners Blog Whitepaper Contact More Rejuve Bio Bringing Neural-Symbolic AI and Cross-Organism Omics Data Together to Cure Aging Rejuve Biotech is combining advanced AI with data from Methuselah flies to develop therapeutics that target aging and age-related disease. Yet it was only a few years later, in 1968, that Princeton physicist Gerald Feinberg wrote The Prometheus Project, a book I discovered in 1974 or so as an elementary school student browsing the town library  which argued that, within possibly just decades, humanity was going to create superhuman AGI, strong nanotechnology along the lines of molecular assemblers, and technologies enabling essential physical immortality. The real question, Feinberg proposed, was not whether or precisely when these feats would be achieved, but rather whether humanity was going to put them to good ends or not, and whether their utilization was going to be guided democratically. Today things look a bit different! Radical human healthspan extension is widely accepted as a reasonable scientific goal, and the US FDA has finally sanctioned aging as a disease category that drugs and other therapies can be approved to address. There are multiple investment firms focusing on companies developing longevity therapeutics. The understanding of the causes of aging has progressed dramatically, with comprehensive perspectives like Aubrey de Greys Seven Pillars of Aging link and the Hallmarks of Aging1,2. For all the radical advances weve seen over the past decades, though, there is still a gap between the present situation and what is really needed for the scientific conquest of involuntary death. While the amount of funding going into solving the aging problem is large by historical standards, its still ridiculously small in comparison to the practical magnitude of the issue. I feel little doubt that our descendants, who have been liberated from death by science, will look back in wonder and befuddlement at the minuscule percentage of global GDP that their ancestors spent on applying science to preventing their own unnecessary demise. We also see today, in the West in particular, a widespread failure to acknowledge the holistic nature of the aging phenomenon. This is merely a special case of the more general failure of modern Western medicine and science to come to grips with the holistic, emergent nature of so many of the important dynamics in complex self-organizing systems (such as bodies, minds, societies the Internet). But its an especially glaring problem in the longevity therapeutics context  because aging is a very definitively whole-body, multi-scale, multi-system, and individually varying phenomenon. Most longevity-oriented research today is focused on highly specific biological factors that influence particular aspects of aging  rather than trying to understand aging as a change of state that affects numerous parts of the body in a coordinated way. Lists like the hallmarks of aging are too often interpreted as collections of problems to be separately addressed, rather than multiple important windows into a unified whole-organism dynamical phenomenon."

    "content": "In line with this overly reductionist scientific focus, most longevity-oriented investment is currently directed toward therapies targeting one small aspect of aging  because these are the easiest ones to study and develop using the standard tools of the pharma industry. To be clear, one can do good this way, and one can prolong human life this way  just not to the same extent that would be possible with a whole-systems approach. The way longevity research currently utilizes AI mostly fits into this same pattern of insufficient whole-system understanding. Using machine learning to make new isolated discoveries about specific biological mechanisms is exciting to be sure. But the real power of AI for longevity will lie in its power to integrate diverse domains and aspects of aging into a unified rigorous understanding. This requires first of all integration of a wide variety of data, and then after that integration of a diversity of AI architectures and approaches to identify a rich ensemble of patterns in this data and conceive hypotheses and experiments accordingly. SingularityNET spinoff Rejuve Network (a separate company to Rejuve Bio) is attacking part of the problem here  creating a decentralized network of longevity enthusiasts who contribute data about their own bodies for analysis and participate in early trials exploring the effectiveness of therapies, including those derived based on their own data. Rejuve Networks Generative Cooperative Network software platform aims at a judicious combination of diverse AI models, paradigms, and approaches to longevity data. Rejuve Network contributes key parts of the puzzle, but solving the aging problem requires additional ingredients as well. Data is key, and the combination of different AI algorithms into appropriate ensembles and networks is key  but there is also the problem of actually discovering and evaluating therapeutics based on applying said AI to said data in a manner that reflects a holistic understanding of aging. Enter Rejuve Biotech, whose AI experts and biomedical scientists have been working together with AGI leaders at SingularityNET and TrueAGI to create a uniquely powerful neural-symbolic framework for analyzing and understanding longevity-related data, systems, and processes. This framework brings together deep neural networks including LLMs and others, with symbolic and evolutionary AI implemented in OpenCog Hyperon, the newest version of the OpenCog integrative AGI toolkit. The Rejuve Bio AI framework applies to all sorts of biomedical data across different systems, organisms and scales. However, particular attention has been paid to one unique source of valuable longevity data to which Rejuve Bio has gained access via its partnership with Genescient Inc. the -omics data from the long-lived Methuselah flies, fruit flies that have been experimentally evolved to live 5x as long as the control flies from which they originated. The Methuselah flies differ dramatically from ordinary-lifespan control flies across multiple different tissues and systems, and the study of their genomics, proteomics, and other aspects provides unique and invaluable insights into how lifespan is coordinated holistically across all the different parts of an organism."

    "content": "The Rejuve Bio AI framework then applies its transfer learning capability to understand the implications of these insights for human longevity, leading to a wide variety of new insights regarding the pathways and networks underlying aging in humans, and potential therapies for extending human healthspan. The practical results of all these AI analytics include suggestions for novel nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, and gene-therapy interventions for healthspan extension. The viability of this approach is demonstrated by work done by the Rejuve Bio founders in an earlier collaboration with Genescient Inc. in 2010, in which the results of AI analytics applied to a much earlier generation of the Methuselah flies were used to guide the creation of novel nutraceuticals which were then trialed on human subjects and demonstrated highly positive impact on biomarkers of aging, as well as delivering immediate health benefit to many.
